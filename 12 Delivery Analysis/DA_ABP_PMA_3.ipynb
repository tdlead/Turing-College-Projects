        "Your manager is very happy with the data you provided him the week before, but now he is interested in how you can handle analysis on your own. He does not give you concrete questions to be answered, just asks you to use any data in the company databases and come up with a useful analysis on your own. It can be from different aspects of the business, but he expects you to provide him with at least 3-5 insights about business.\n",
        "\n",
        "You should use tables from [olist_db](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery?project=tc-da-1&ws=!1m5!1m4!4m3!1stc-da-1!2solist_db!3solist_customesr_dataset&j=bq:US:bquxjob_439ea020_17f990edf1c&page=queryresults) to come up with an analysis on your own. You will have to write SQL queries to extract needed data, then analyze and make a visualisation using your preferred data visualisation tool (Google Sheets / Tableau / Looker Studio). After all this, you will have to come up with a presentation oriented to executives from your company. Have in mind your audience for the presentation, these will be business oriented people who are not data analysts and may not have studied statistics before.\n",

        "- See whether you can apply at least 2 techniques learned in this or previous sprints\n",
        "- Explore the data. See whether there are interesting data points that can give more insights to your presentation.\n",

        "*Tip: to make valuable business insights, itâ€™s almost never enough to only look at the data. It is often very beneficial to do some additional research about the industry and the business as well. Such ability to learn quickly about different domains is an extremely valuable skill, especially when starting jobs at new companies.*\n",
