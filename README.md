# Turing-College-Projects

During my time at the Turing College Bootcamp, I completed 11 real-data projects. These projects helped me develop key skills in data analysis/ data science:

- I learned to analyze data, from asking the right questions to sharing the results.
- I became proficient in advanced SQL for data extraction using Bigquery.
- I gained experience in data cleaning and transformation using both SQL and Python.
- I can now manipulate and visualize data effectively using Python.
- I'm skilled in creating data visualizations with Tableau.
- Extracting meaningful insights from data became second nature.
- I improved my presentation and communication skills for sharing findings effectively.

These experiences have prepared me for a career as Data Analyst/ Decision Scientist.
